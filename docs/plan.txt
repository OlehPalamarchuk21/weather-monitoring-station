Phase 1. Preparation
	1.1) Selection of technologies and tools (project creation)
	1.2) Generation of master document (README.md)
	1.3) Introducing the AI agent to the project (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md)
Phase 2. Planning
	2.2) Creation of implementation plan (AI in planning mode, TDD)
	2.3) Approval of plan details (ultrasynking)
	2.4) Step-by-step plan (step-by-step implementation plan file)
Phase 3. Implementation
	3.1) Creation of tests and then implementation for each step (red, green)
	3.2) Marking in the plan what has been done (updating the implementation plan file)
	3.3) Running all tests (successful passing of all tests)
	3.4) Updating documentation
Phase 4. Completion
	4.1) Fragmented refactoring (by packages, by classes)
	4.2) Full refactoring (generation of a file with suggestions and execution of certain changes)
	4.3) Final run of all tests (deletion of the refactoring suggestions file - code development completed)
	4.4) Final documentation update
